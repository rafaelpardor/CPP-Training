### Kind of Variables

1. **Instance Variables (non-static)**:They are instance variables so they are unique
to each instance/object of a class.

2. **Class Variables (static)**: A class variable is any field with the *static* modifier.
These variables are linked with the class not with the object of the class. There is
exactly one copy of these variables regardless of how many instances of the class
are created.

3. **Local Variables**: The temporary variables in a method are called local variables.
The local variables are only visible to the method in which they are declared. The
parameters that are passed to the methods are also local variables of the called method.
