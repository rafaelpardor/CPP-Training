# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Chapter 3: Approach to Solve Algorithms Design Problems

Know the theorical knowledge of the algorithm is essential, but is not sufficient. An approach to solve an algorithm design question, is to master 5 steps.

### 1. Costraints

Solving a technical question is not just about knowing the algorithms and designing a good software system. There are a lot of data that is missing that you need to collect from the interviewer.

We should not never try to solve a problem that is not completely defined. Interview questions are not like exam paper where all the details about the problem are well defined.

For example: *When the problem statement says that write ana lgorithm to sort numbers*.

Let's suppose that the numbers are Integer types, and the input data size differs from 100 to 1 bil integers.

Basic guidelines for the Constrains for an array of numbers:

1. How many numbers of elements in the array?

2. What is the range of value in each element? What is the min and max value?

3. Does the array containt unique data or not

Basic guidelines for the Constrains for an array of string:

1. How many numbers of elements in the array?

2. What is the length of each string? What is the min and max length?

3. Does the array contain unique data or not?

Basic guidelines for the Constrains for a Graph:

1. How many nodes are in the graph?

2. Hoe many edges are there in the graph?

3. Is it a weighted graph? What is the range of weigths?

4. Is the graph directed or undirected?

5. Is there a loop in the graph?

6. Is there negative sum loop in the graph?

7. Does the graph have self-loops?

### 2. Ideas Generation

We should know how to handle new problems.

How to solve a new problem? **Practice**, a lot of practice. When you have solved enough problems, you will be able to see a patterns in questions and be able to solve new problems easy.

You can follow this patterns to solve an unknown problem:

1. Try to simplify the task in hand

2. Try a few examples.

3. Think to suitable data-structure

4. Think about similar problems you have already solved

### 3. Complexities

Solving a problem is not just finding a correct solution. The solution should be fast and should have reasonable memory requirement.

### 4. Coding

Never ever, jump into coding before discussing constraints.

### 5. Testing

Once the code is written, you are not done. It is most important that you test your code with several small cases. It shows that you understand the importance of testing. It also gives confifence that you don't write buggy code.
